## About this plugin
WordPress Plugin Skeleton **is not a _real_** WordPress plugin: it has been created to regroup some of the best practices in plugin development for WordPress.
You can still install it on a WordPress powered site, it won't break anything and will provide some functionnalities (but not very useful...).

## Functionnalities
This plugin provides sample code for these functionnalities of WordPress plugins:

* table(s) creation in database
* cron job scheduling with manual activation in admin panel
* localization (currently French and English are supported, but it's only an example)
* custom post type creation
* custom taxonomy creation
* application of an existing taxonomy on a custom post type
* AJAX calls
    * on front (click on a post content)
    * on admin (click on a page's main content)
* shortcode support with:
    * attributes support
    * tinyMCE plugin for displaying a button
    * front display
* settings page creation with:
    * two examples fields (select and radio)
    * link to this page displayed in 'Plugins' page
* widget creation:
    * displays a list of custom posts
    * has a cache system

## To come
With WordPress 3.3, we will have more options to develop our plugins. I want to continue editing this skeleton plugin with new functionnalities coming.
For example, the '**WP-Pointers**' would be great to implement here.
